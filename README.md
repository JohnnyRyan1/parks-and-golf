**Fig. 5** Characteristics of people who live within 1 km of a golf course, but further than 1 km from other types of greenspace for the fifty largest cities in the US by population. The size of the circles represents the number of people. Overall, people who live near golf courses but far from other types of greenspace tend to be wealthier and whiter than the city average.
